# Top-Down Shooter

### Running

Since this project is a browser game, you just need to host it somewhere. `file://` is not enough, images don't load.

If you have the Emscripten SDK, you can host by running

```
emrun .
```

Your browser should open automatically.

### Building

If you have the Emscripten SDK, you can build by running

```
./build.sh
```

If you don't have the Emscripten SDK, you need to install it.

From (https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)[the official docs]:
```bash
# run these commands in a shell
# in the folder where you keep your code / git clones
git clone https://github.com/juj/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk update
# this will take some time
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
# close the shell and reopen in the project folder
```
